Welcome to the website of the Data-driven Analysis of Peace Project
(DAPP) lab. Founded by William G. Nomikos, the lab supports the efforts of
[affiliated researchers](/people) studying many [different aspects](/research)
of building peace in fragile settings.

A key function of the lab is to support the research of junior scholars,
especially graduate students. Prospective WashU PhD students interested in
joining the lab should contact [Prof. Nomikos](mailto:wnomikos@wustl.edu)
directly. The lab offers graduate students access to data, research-related
resources, and venues to present ongoing research. We especially encourage
women, first generation students, students with disabilities, BIPoC students,
and other students from historically excluded groups to contact us about the
lab.

The lab is financially supported by the
[Weidenbaum Center on the Economy, Government, and Public Policy](https://wc.wustl.edu)
at [Washington University in St. Louis](https://wustl.edu) and the
[Folke Bernadotte Academy](https://fba.se/en/).
