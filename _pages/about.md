Welcome to the website of the Data-driven Analysis of Peace Project
(DAPP) lab. Founded by William G. Nomikos, the lab is currently researching
projects related to climate change and conflict. In the past, we've conducted
research on UN peacekeeping operations and how international conflict shapes
social media discourse about politics in the United States. 

A key function of the lab is to support the research of junior scholars,
especially graduate students. Prospective UCSB PhD students and current UCSB
undergraduate students interested in joining the lab should contact
[Prof. Nomikos](mailto:wnomikos@ucsb.edu) directly. The lab offers graduate
students access to data, research-related resources, and venues to present
ongoing research. We especially encourage women, first generation students,
students with disabilities, BIPoC students, and other students from
historically-excluded groups to contact us about the lab.

The lab also seeks to support research transparency and bridge the gap between
data scientists and the peace science community. All of the code that supports
the infrastructure of the lab, including the RADPKO dataset, is available on the
lab's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dapp-lab). We encourage broad use
of the lab's resources, and are happy to discuss opportunities for
collaboration.

The lab is financially supported by the
[Weidenbaum Center on the Economy, Government, and Public Policy](https://wc.wustl.edu)
at [Washington University in St. Louis](https://wustl.edu) and the
[Folke Bernadotte Academy](https://fba.se/en/).
