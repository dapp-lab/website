Welcome to the website of the Data-driven Analysis of Peacekeeping Project
(DAPP) lab. The lab studies United Nations peacekeeping operations using novel
datasets on UN peacekeeping activities throughout the world. Founded by William
G. Nomikos, the lab supports the efforts of [affiliated researchers](/people)
studying many [different aspects](/research) of UN peacekeeping.

A key function of the lab is to support the research of junior scholars,
especially graduate students. Prospective WashU PhD students interested in
joining the lab should contact [Prof. Nomikos](mailto:wnomikos@wustl.edu)
directly. The lab offers graduate students access to data, research-related
resources, and venues to present ongoing research.

The lab is financially supported by the
[Weidenbaum Center on the Economy, Government, and Public Policy](https://wc.wustl.edu)
at [Washington University in St. Louis](https://wustl.edu) and the
[Folke Bernadotte Academy](https://fba.se/en/).
