abstract: 'Despite abundant evidence that UN peacekeepers limit armed group violence during and after civil wars, we know relatively little about their ability to contain more localized forms of violence between non-state actors. Given the recent rise in atrocities and mass displacements due to communal violence across the African continent, evaluating the effectiveness of peacekeeping at this level is a pressing concern. This article demonstrates that peacekeeping troops prevent the onset of communal violence. I use data from a survey experiment conducted in Mali to show that the likely explanation for the effectiveness of UN peacekeepers is that locals see them as impartial. I discuss the implications for understanding the effectiveness of UN peacekeepers from different cultural backgrounds. The paper concludes that UN peacekeepers may limit the outbreak of communal violence even in the most challenging settings.'
