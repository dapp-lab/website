abstract: "Over the last twenty years, the literature has sought to understand the conditions in which peacekeeping operations (PKOs) take place and the efficacy of their presence. Much of the current work has focused on PKOs' relationship to civilians in the context of civil conflict but less is understood about the quality of the peacekeeping missions themselves. If PKOs commit human rights abuses, how might this behavior be deterred in the domestic context? We theorize the presence of INGOs provide both a monitoring and socializing effect on PKOs. Using the PKAT and TSMO datasets, we analyze all peacekeeping missions from 2007-2013. The findings from this paper describe the function which INGOs serve in relationship to PKOs as they operate together in politically unstable and transitioning regions. "
